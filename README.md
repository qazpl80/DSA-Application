# DSA-Application

## Details

This program make use of at least one data structure. It is used to demonstrate application of algorithms learnt (e.g. searching, sorting, recursion etc). </br>
</br>
In addition to the basic requirements outlined above, the program might contain additional features.  </br>
</br>
Examples of additional features: </br>
</br>
•	Graphical User Interface </br>
•	Advanced data structures (such as composite/ modified data structures, other data structures e.g. doubly linked lists, self-organizing lists, quad trees, ternary trees, graphs etc) </br>
•	Algorithm and data structures optimization </br>
•	Comparison of different data structures/algorithm and its efficacy </br>
</br>

## Pre-launch settings and Note </br>
The program might/might not require the following to be done before it can be launched: </br>
